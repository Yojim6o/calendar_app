# Calendar App

This is a simple one-month calendar made using browser-native javascript.  No frameworks, libraries, or Babel.

###Environment Setup###

Within your terminal, use the following commands:

```
    > git clone git@github.com:Yojim6o/calendar_app.git
    > cd calendar_app
```

When ready, open calendar_app/index.html within Chrome.

###How to use###

The app displays all dates for the current month.  Clicking on the current date or a future date will pull up a modal, which can be used to view/create/update/delete appointments. If an appointment overlaps with another, conflict warnings will display until resolved.

###Road Map###

- Lots of refactoring
